# TCS-RIO-Sentiment-Analysis
## Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Dataset Project
This project is about sentiment analysis of the IMDb dataset. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content of the review.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDb dataset, which contains a collection of movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset is available for download at https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. It contains 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews labeled as positive and 25,000 reviews labeled as negative.

## Model
The machine learning model used in this project are various models. The model is trained on the IMDb dataset using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library. The model takes as input the text content of the movie review and outputs a prediction of whether the review is positive or negative.


## Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set, which indicates that it can accurately classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their text content.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
